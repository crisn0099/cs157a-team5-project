The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner\'s body, and gets back to the game\'s starting area. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game\'s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.\n\nDead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.\n\nThe players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. \n\nThe game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can\'t take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.','2018-08-07','Teen','https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f90/f90ee1a4239247a822771c40488e68c5.jpg','Plug In Digital','https://dead-cells.com/'),(66,'The Wolf Among Us','The Wolf Among Us is a five-part episodic game relying heavily on dialogues and choices of the player.

The game features two story-oriented modes: Character Story and A Shadow Falls. In Character Story you can choose any character to go through a series of fights. It starts with a prologue and finishes with ending unique for each character. At launch only, Characters Story was available while A Shadow Falls, a full-fledged story mode that describes a battle between World Fighters and criminal syndicate Shandaloo was added later in July 2016.\n  \n###Gameplay \nLike its predecessors, Street Fighter is a 2D one-on-one fighting game. The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character.

The game takes heavy inspiration from the founder series of its genre, Super Smash Bros., and specifically its second entry, Super Smash Bros. Melee. Dan Fornace describes himself as a long-time fan of the Smash Bros. series, being the developer of the 2010 \'de-make\' fangame Super Smash Land.\n\nLike in Smash Bros., instead of a traditional fighting game arena, a game of Rivals of Aether takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked back when hit. The goal of the game is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied moveset. Two to four players can take part in the same game, in a free-for-all or a team battle. \n\nRivals of Aether differs from the Smash Bros. series in that, instead of having Smash Bros.\' enormous amount of content, it puts heavy focus on its competitive aspect. The game features a tightly balanced roster of 14 characters (including 2 guest characters) and every stage has an unique variation designed for competitive play. The game pulls the roots of its mechanics from the second entry in the Smash Bros. series, Super Smash Bros. Melee, famous for its competitive depth and aggressive gameplay (many advanced techniques from different entries of Super Smash Bros. are present, such as wavedashing, Reverse Aerial Rush or moonwalking, and the game is balanced with them in consideration), and tries to improve on them while cultivating its own original dynamics ; among other things, the classic shield has been replaced with a parry, which can stun opponents if it succeeds, at the risk of a significant recovery period if it doesn\'t).\n\nThe game has gathered a decently-sized competitive scene and is ran along with Smash Bros. at various major tournaments such as Genesis or Frostbite, in addition of having its own championship series and other tournament series, primarily in the United States.\n\nAs all DLC characters for Rivals of Aether have been released, a Definitive Edition of the game is set to release in the future, on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and potentially PlayStation 4.','2017-03-28','Everyone 10+','https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a0e8a4379d465ac6c17a599456b5374.jpg','Dan Fornace','http://rivalsofaether.com'),(96,'Path of Exile','Path of Exile is inspired by Diablo II and follows it basically in most of the aspects.
